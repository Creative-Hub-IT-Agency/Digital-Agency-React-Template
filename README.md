### Your job is to give it a live, add relative image, icons and replace the dummy text with relevant text
### You have to host the images on imgbb, imggur or some other platform, and keep all the images in a single folder (not in the project folder) for future reference
### After completing the template, you have to show your team leader and then build on vercel, netlify or surge. You have to solve the build time error as well.

## The deadline is 30 January, 2025
